3. Funded applicants will forward their invoice for payment by the UI-OAPF
  
### Invoices and Reimbursement

The UI-OAPF prefers to pay journals directly, thus minimizing out-of-pocket cost to the authors. Upon funding approval, the funded applicant will forward their invoice directly to the Libraryâ€™s Administrative Financial Specialist ([Jennifer Mylan](mailto:jmylan@uidaho.edu)) and the UI-OAPF Fund Manager ([Jylisa Doney](mailto:jylisadoney@uidaho.edu)), or direct the journal to do so.

However, in case of publication deadlines, authors may opt to be reimbursed with proper documentation of payment. The UI-OAPF will review other possible payment options as needed, e.g. paying out of departments with intra-institutional account transfers.
