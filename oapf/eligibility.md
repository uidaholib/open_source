# Eligibility and Guidelines

This fund supports all UI authors, regardless of rank or position, and sets conditions on which journals can be supported in order to prevent exploitation by publishers and to provide clear criteria about eligibility.

Applications are accepted on a first come, first served basis starting July 1, 2018 until funding is exhausted or the end of the fiscal year.

Additionally, authors interested in the UI-OAPF are strongly encouraged to speak with their [liaison librarian](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/liaisons.html) or the UI-OAPF Fund Manager ([Jylisa Doney](mailto:jylisadoney@uidaho.edu)) to determine whether journals and publishers meet the eligibility criteria.

## Article Criteria
Articles must be accepted for publication prior to submitting a funding application.

Funding per article is capped at $2000.00.

## Journal Criteria
Journals must be listed in the [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) (DOAJ) and journal publishers must be members of, or comply with, the [Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association](https://oaspa.org/membership/members/) (OASPA).

All journals must utilize peer-review and make articles fully open upon publication.

We use OASPA and DOAJ membership criteria to verify that publishers and journals adhere to responsible, sustainable, and non-exploitative publishing behavior.

## Author Criteria
Current University of Idaho faculty, staff, researchers, or enrolled students are eligible to apply for funds.

Funding per author is capped at $3000.00 per year. Based on funding availability, authors may apply for funding multiple times until their cap is met, funds are exhausted, or the fiscal year ends.

### Multi-Authored Works
The fund will cover a maximum of $2000.00 per article. The article maximum is prorated per University of Idaho author and determined by dividing the article process charges (APCs) by the number of UI authors. Each eligible UI author can receive up to the prorated portion of the APCs (subject to their individual author cap), while the prorated portion for non-UI authors is not eligible for funding.

For example, if an article had four eligible UI authors, each author could receive funding up to $500 ($2000 / 4 UI authors = $500 per UI author). If an article had two eligible UI authors and one non-UI author, the proration would be $2000 / 2 UI authors = $1000 per UI author.

## External Funding Criteria
We strongly encourage researchers to request funding for open access publications from their funding agency if they can do so. Authors with sufficient funding from grants or contracts are encouraged to use those funds to allow others to share in the benefit of open publications. Priority will be given to applications without other sources of funding available.

## Conditions for Funded Articles
Funded authors must include the following statement in the article’s acknowledgements section: “Publication of this article was funded by the University of Idaho Open Access Publishing Fund”.

Funded authors are also required to deposit a copy of the funded article in the UI institutional repository (IR).
