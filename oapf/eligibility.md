# Eligibility and Guidelines

UI-OAPF accepts applications on a first-come, first-served basis until funds are exhausted or the end of the fiscal year.

UI authors interested in the UI-OAPF are strongly encouraged to speak with their [liaison librarian](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/liaisons.html) or the UI-OAPF Fund Manager ([Jylisa Doney](mailto:jylisadoney@uidaho.edu)) to determine whether journals and publishers meet the eligibility criteria.

#### Articles 

* must be accepted for publication before submitting a UI-OAPF application.
* Funding per article is capped at $2000.00.

#### Journals

* Must be listed in the [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) (DOAJ) 
* Must utilize peer-review
* Must make articles fully open upon publication

#### Journal Publishers

* Must be members of, or comply with, the [Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association](https://oaspa.org/membership/members/) (OASPA)

We use DOAJ and OASPA membership criteria to verify that publishers and journals adhere to responsible, sustainable, and non-exploitative publishing behavior.
Please note that "hybrid journals", toll-access journals that make certain articles freely available, are ineligible for funding.

Open access membership fees, such as PeerJ Memberships, will be considered on a case-by-case basis if other eligibility requirements are met.

#### Authors 

* Current UI faculty, staff, researchers, and enrolled students are eligible to apply for funds.
* Funding per author is capped at $3000.00 per fiscal year. 
* Authors may apply for funding multiple times until their cap is met or funds are exhausted.

For **multi-authored works** the article maximum ($2000.00) is prorated per UI author and determined by dividing the article process charges (APCs) by the number of UI authors.

#### External Funding

We strongly encourage researchers to request funding for open access publications from their funding agency if they can do so. 
Authors with sufficient funding from grants or contracts are encouraged to use those funds to allow others to share in the benefit of open publications. 

Priority will be given to UI-OAPF applications without other sources of funding available.
