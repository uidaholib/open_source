# The University of Idaho Open Access Publishing Fund (UI-OAPF) and its Partners 
As a land grant university, the University of Idaho seeks to “shape the future through innovative thinking,” and “expand the institution’s intellectual and economic impact.”<sup>1</sup> The UI-OAPF, with generous funding from the University of Idaho Library, Office of the Provost, and Office of Research and Economic Development, supports this vision by making the innovative research conducted at our university as widely accessible as possible. Supporting open access models of publication demonstrates that the University of Idaho embraces equity of access, which is a catalyst for increased impact and visibility throughout the state, nation, and beyond.

Open access and the UI-OAPF also tie into the University of Idaho Strategic Plan:
* *Goal 1 – Innovate*: Heighten the visibility of the University of Idaho’s research, innovation, scholarship, and creative works.
* *Goal 2 – Engage*: Reduce barriers related to accessing the University of Idaho’s research, innovation, scholarship, and creative works.

The UI-OAPF supports all UI authors, regardless of rank or position, and sets conditions on which journals can be supported in an effort to preven exploitation by publishers and provide clear eligibility criteria. 

For the the pilot year (FY 19), the fund partners have allocated $30,000 to pay  article processing charges (APCs) in eligible open access journals. Applications that meet all eligibility criteria, including article and author caps, are accepted on a first-come, first-served basis starting July 1, 2018 until funds are exhausted or the end of the fiscal year.
