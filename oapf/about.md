As a land grant university, the University of Idaho (UI) seeks to “shape the future through innovative thinking” and “expand the institution’s intellectual and economic impact.”<sup>1</sup> 

The UI-OAPF supports this vision by making the innovative research conducted at UI as widely accessible as possible.

Supporting open access models of publication demonstrates that UI embraces equity of access, which is a catalyst for increased impact and visibility throughout the state, nation, and beyond.

Open access and the UI-OAPF also tie into the University of Idaho Strategic Plan:
* *Goal 1 – Innovate*: Heighten the visibility of the University of Idaho’s research, innovation, scholarship, and creative works.
* *Goal 2 – Engage*: Reduce barriers related to accessing the University of Idaho’s research, innovation, scholarship, and creative works.

For the pilot year (FY 19), the fund partners have allocated $30,000 to pay article processing charges (APCs) in eligible open access journals. 

Applications that meet all eligibility criteria, including article and author caps, are accepted on a first-come, first-served basis starting July 1, 2018 until funds are exhausted or the end of the fiscal year.
