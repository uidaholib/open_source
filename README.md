## Notes 

### Bootstrap 4.1

Bootstrap [components docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/alerts/)

### Fontawesome 5.0.13 free

[fontawesome cheatsheet](https://fontawesome.com/cheatsheet)

Only a subset of icons is currently loaded: ["regular" & "free" icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=regular&m=free).
The full sets are in the project, and could be added instead.

Could be loaded via two methods:

1. CSS + webfonts: traditional method, load webfonts. good with lots of icons on the page, simple, low CPU use.
2. JS + SVG: newer method, insert SVG icons using JS. good with fewer icons, higher CPU use.

Both methods are add the project, but it is using currently using CSS, check comments in `_includes/head.html`.

[Accessibility info](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/accessibility):

- JS + SVG version adds accessibility aria labels automatically. If the icon has semantic meaning, add a `title=` attribute to the fa `<i>`.
- CSS + webfonts version, need to add aria labels manually. 
    - decorative icons: add `aria-hidden` to element, e.g. `<i class="fas fa-camera-retro" aria-hidden></i>`
    - semantic icons: add `aria-hidden` and a `title` to element, plus add description with `class="sr-only"`.
