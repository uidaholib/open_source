UI-OAPF Basics,What is the UI-OAPF?,The University of Idaho Open Access Publishing Fund (UI-OAPF) supports University of Idaho authors in their efforts to publish in open access journals by paying article processing charges (APCs).
UI-OAPF Basics,Who is providing funding for the UI-OAPF?,"Funding is provided by the University of Idaho Library, Office of the Provost, and Office of Research and Economic Development. A total of $30,000 has been allocated for the fund's pilot year (FY 19)."
UI-OAPF Basics,Who manages the UI-OAPF?,"The fund is administered by a small group of people contributing a percentage of their time, centered in the UI Library, with three main roles: Fund Manager, Fund Processing Staff, and Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committee is composed of representatives from the Library Affairs Committee of the Faculty Senate. Additional support comes from liaison librarians as part of their conventional duties to their colleges."
UI-OAPF Basics,Why is this publishing fund important for the University of Idaho?,"An Open Access Fund enacts the vision and land-grant mission of the University of Idaho by making the innovative research conducted at the University as widely and easily accessible as possible. In turn, this accessibility is a catalyst for increased impact and visibility of University throughout the state, nation, and beyond. The UI-OAPF also connects to Goal 1 - Innovate and Goal 2 - Engage in the Strategic Plan."
UI-OAPF Basics,Do other universities have open access publishing funds?,"Yes, many other colleges and university have open access publishing funds. Visit the <a href='http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/OA_publication_funds' target='_blank'>OA Publication Funds wiki</a> to learn more about publishing funds in the United States and around the world."
UI-OAPF Basics,Will fund outcomes and metrics be publicly available?,"Yes, a publicly available annual report will document all fund outcomes and metrics."
Guidelines,What happens if an article has multiple authors?,"The fund will cover a maximum of $2000.00 per article. The article maximum is prorated per University of Idaho author and determined by dividing the article process charges (APCs) by the number of UI authors. Each eligible UI author can receive up to the prorated portion of the APCs (subject to their individual author cap), while the prorated portion for non-UI authors is not eligible for funding. For example, if an article had two eligible UI authors and one non-UI author, the proration would be $2000 / 2 UI authors = up to $1000 per UI author."
Guidelines,Are there caps on funding?,"Yes, the funding cap is $2000.00 per article and $3000.00 per author/year. Based on funding availability, authors may apply for funding multiple times until their cap is met, funds are exhausted, or the fiscal year ends."
Guidelines,"Do authors need to exhaust other funding sources that cover APCs, such as grants, before applying to the UI-OAPF?","Yes, we strongly encourage researchers to request funding for open access publications from their funding agency if they can do so. Priority will be given to applications without other sources of funding available."
Guidelines,"Can the UI-OAPF be used to cover other open access publication types, such as conference presentations and books?","Not at this time. Other open access publication types, such as books, book chapters, and conference proceedings may be supported in the future."
Procedures and Process,What is the review process and who decides which applications receive funding?,"When applications are received, the UI-OAPF Fund Manager will use a standard rubric to evaluate applications against the eligibility criteria and approve or reject funding requests. The UI-OAPF Fund Manager will then share funding decisions and a copy of the rubric with applicants via email."
Procedures and Process,What is the procedure for payment or reimbursement?,"Upon funding approval, the author will forward the invoice directly to the Library's Administrative Financial Specialist and the UI-OAPF Fund Manager, or direct the journal to do so. The article processing charges will be paid directly to the journal publisher. The fund prefers to pay journals directly, thus minimizing out-of-pocket cost to the authors. However, in case of publication deadlines, authors may opt to be reimbursed with proper documentation of the payment. The UI-OAPF will review other possible payment options as needed, e.g paying out of departments with intra-institutional account transfers."
Open Access Basics,What is open access?,"Open access (OA) is the practice of providing free, unrestricted access to content via the Internet, most commonly to scholarly journal articles. OA removes price barriers between users and content and is compatible with peer review, copyright, preservation, and quality associated with conventional scholarly literature."
Open Access Basics,What is a hybrid journal?,A hybrid journal is a toll-access journal that makes certain articles freely available under open licenses.
Open Access Basics,Are open access journals peer reviewed?,"Yes, open access journals are compatible with peer review. The UI-OAPF only accepts applications for articles that are published in peer reviewed open access journals."
Open Access Basics,Are there other ways to make my research freely available to readers?,"Yes, as an author you often have the right to place a version of your article in an institutional repository (IR), such as the UI IR, or a disciplinary repository. However, your rights and the details about the specific article version are determined by your publication agreements with publishers."
