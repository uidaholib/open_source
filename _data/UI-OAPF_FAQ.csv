What is the procedure for payment or reimbursement?,"Upon funding approval, the author will forward the invoice directly to the Library's Administrative Financial Specialist and the UI-OAPF Fund Manager, or direct the journal to do so. The article processing charges will be paid directly to the journal publisher. The fund prefers to pay journals directly, thus minimizing out-of-pocket cost to the authors. However, in case of publication deadlines, authors may opt to be reimbursed with proper documentation of the payment. The UI-OAPF will review other possible payment options as needed, e.g paying out of departments with intra-institutional account transfers."
What is open access?,"Open access (OA) is the practice of providing free, unrestricted access to content via the Internet, most commonly to scholarly journal articles. �OA removes price barriers between users and content and is compatible with peer review, copyright, preservation, and quality associated with conventional scholarly literature."

However, your rights and the details about the specific article version are determined by your publication agreements with publishers."
